# Pattern Mobile Audit

## Goals
Audit the PatternFly widgets, patterns and components to determine which patterns are ready for mobile.

## Requirements
Each pattern will be evaluated according to the following criteria:
* responsiveness
* touch size of the UI controls
* relevance (does the pattern even make sense for mobile)

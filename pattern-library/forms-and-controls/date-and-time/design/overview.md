# Date and Time

The date and  time picker allows a user to select a single point in time or a time range. Time can be expressed as a date, a time of day, or a combination of both. Common use cases are selecting a date and time for something to run or expire and filtering events by their timestamp. The date and time picker is based on the Bootstrap-datetimepicker. See the
[bootstrap-datepicker doc](http://http://eonasdan.github.io/bootstrap-datetimepicker/) for complete documentation.

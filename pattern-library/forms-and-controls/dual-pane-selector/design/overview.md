# Pattern Name Goes Here

## Overview
The Dual Pane Selectors allow users to visually compare available and selected items and move items between those states.  It is recommended to use when:
- A user needs to move items from one list to another.
- A many to many data model is needed
- A user needs to visually distribute items between lists.

When those conditions are not met, the [Bootstrap Multiple Select widget](http://www.patternfly.org/pattern-library/widgets/#bootstrap-select) shoud be considered.

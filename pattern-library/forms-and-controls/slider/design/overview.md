# Slider

The slider component allows users to visualize a relative amount or portion of a whole. The slider should be implemented when users are required to set a value that falls within a bounded range in order to provide visual feedback about where that value falls. Sliders can have a discrete or continuous scale, depending on the use case. Continuous scales simply rely on a min and max value whereas discrete scales allow users to snap to specific values.

Use cases for sliders can vary a great deal, but some examples include:
  - Setting storage size, memory limit, or other configuration options
  - Setting a time range on a chart
  - Setting price ranges or other filters

# Checkbox Filter

![a checkbox filter](./img/checkbox-filter-callout.png)
1. **Filter Dropdown** (optional): Clicking this dropdown opens and closes the filter panel. A checkbox filter embedded in the page does not require a dropdown.
1. **Filter Textbox** (optional): If a text-based filter such as a keyword filter is required, a textbox may be included at the top of the filter panel. No more than one textbox should be included in a checkbox filter if possible. If more than one is required, consider using a different filter pattern instead.
1. **Filter Category**: These labels describe the category of the values below them. Examples include "Color", "Status" etc.
1. **Filter Value**: Examples include "Red", "Blue", "Running", "Stopped", etc. Clicking the checkbox next to a value will add a filter for that value and its associated category. If possible, values should be accompanied by a number in parentheses that represents the number of items in the set that match that value.
1. **Active Filters**: See [filter](http://www.patternfly.org/pattern-library/forms-and-controls/filter/) for a description of active filters and their behavior.

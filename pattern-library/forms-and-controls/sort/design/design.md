  1. **Sort Selector:** Contains a list of the possible attributes by which to sort. Objects may be sorted by any attribute, including properties that are not displayed in the current view. (e.g. attributes in hidden columns, or those that are not displayed in a tile)

  1. **Sort Order Toggle:** Sort can toggle between ascending and descending order. The icon on this button changes according to the order of the current sort. The default for sort is ascending order.


  | Icon | Class Name | Tooltip Text | Screenreader Text (aria-label) | Comments |
  | ---- | ---------- | ------------ | ------------------------------ | -------- |
  | ![Image of sort](img/fa-sort-alpha-asc.png) | fa-sort-alpha-ascending | Sort Z to A | Sorted A to Z. Toggle to sort Z to A. | This icon and text would display regardless of data type. The icon and text use “A to Z” as an example to communicate sort order, and are not intended to indicate type of data that displays in the selected column. |
  | ![Image of sort](img/fa-sort-alpha-desc.png) | fa-sort-alpha-descending | Sort A to Z | Sorted Z to A. Toggle to sort A to Z. | See comments in previous row. |

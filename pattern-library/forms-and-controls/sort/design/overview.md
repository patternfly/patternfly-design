# Sort

Sort enables users to quickly sort a view of objects by a single attribute. Sort is often displayed as a component of the [Toolbar](http://www.patternfly.org/pattern-library/forms-and-controls/toolbar/).

When the current data is displayed as a table with sortable columns, the sort widget should be hidden and user can sort columns by clicking on the column header. See [Table View](http://www.patternfly.org/pattern-library/content-views/table-view/#/design) for more information.

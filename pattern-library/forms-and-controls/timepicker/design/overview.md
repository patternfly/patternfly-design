# Timepicker

The timepicker allows a user to select a time. The most common use case is selecting a time for something to run or expire. The timepicker widget is based on the Bootstrap-datetimepicker. See the [Bootstrap 3 Datepicker v4 Docs](http://eonasdan.github.io/bootstrap-datetimepicker/#bootstrap-3-datepicker-v4-docs) for complete documentation.

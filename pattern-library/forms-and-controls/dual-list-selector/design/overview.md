# Dual List Selector


## Overview

The Dual List Selector component is used to move items from one list to another.

They are best used when more than 30 items appear in a list, a many to many data model is needed or if there is a specific applicable use case. Lists under 30 items should consider using the [Bootstrap Multiple Select widget](http://www.patternfly.org/pattern-library/widgets/#bootstrap-select).

This design is recommended for desktop or tablet applications where the lists remain side by side.

## Use Cases

Any situation where the user is required to move an item or items from one list to another. Lists are displayed side by side so that all information is presented together. This is best used when items are easily identifiable by name only as other properties are not displayed within the pane.

* Used for moving items from an inactive to active state or vice versa

* Used for moving items from an available to a selected state or vice versa

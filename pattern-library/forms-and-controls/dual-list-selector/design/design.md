  1. **Filter/Search**
    - Type-ahead filter allows you to easily reduce long lists to more quickly find items.
  1. **Sort** (optional):
    - Default sort will be alphabetical.
    - Additional sorting options are dependent on the data.
  1. **Action Menu** (optional):
      - Additional actions can be presented in a kabob.
  1. **Item  Movement Buttons**
    - Used to move selected items between the two state panes.
  1. **Scrolling**
      - The panes should have flexible widths and a maximum height.
      - A maximum height limit would be met with a scroll to accommodate additional list items.
      - Both panes should be of equal height.
  1. **Item Count Labels**
      - The bottom of each pane should have a count to the number of items selected out of total items available.

1. **Hover Highlight**
  - Highlight should exist on hover.
1. **Selected Highlight and Checkmark**
  - Selected items are highlighted with the checkmark state changed to include checked icon to visually reinforce item selection. This is particularly useful when multiple selections have been made.
1. **Moving an Item**
  - After an item(s) has been selected, the Shuttle Buttons move the items to the desired state pane.
  - After items are moved they remain highlighted in their new state pane as visual confirmation. They remain highlighted until a new selection is made. This is so item movement can be easily undone.
  - If no known sort methodology is determined, items will added to the bottom of the list.
1. **Selecting within Both Panes**
  - The panes participate in mutually exclusive interaction. Only the items in one state pane may be selected at any give time. All checkboxes are active until a selection is made within one pane. Checkboxes should be disabled for the non active pane.

## Bulk Moving

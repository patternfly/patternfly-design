## Overview
Forms will often have a mix of optional and required fields. When optional and required fields are both present in a form, there needs to be some way for users to discern between the two.

## Examples

### Pattern Example
![Title of image](img/image-name-goes-here.jpg)

### Pattern Variation Example
![Title of image 2](img/image-name-goes-here-2.jpg)

1. **Position and Results Count:** The first number shows the position of the currently focused result. The second number shows the total number of matching objects.

## Find Results

1. **Found Objects:** All objects that match the user’s query are shaded to differentiate them from non-matching objects.

1. **Focused Object:** The first matching object is brought into view by scrolling or paging and highlighted. When the focus is changed via the previous/next buttons, the view should change, if necessary, to display the newly focused object.

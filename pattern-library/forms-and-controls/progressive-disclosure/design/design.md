1. **Parent Control:** This control either shows or hides fields based on whether or not it’s selected.

1. **Progressive Disclosure:** Additional input fields or controls that are children of the parent control are indented to denote that they are a subset of the previous selection. Whether or not these fields and/or controls are visible is dependent on the selected state of the parent control.

# Progressive Disclosure

This pattern uses progressive disclosure to hide and show fields based on a particular selection. The workflow is simple and the user can focus on the task at hand. This approach saves usersâ€™ time from unnecessarily identifying what fields can or cannot be interacted with. This approach is also helpful to color-blind users because it avoids using color to indicate whether or not a field is available.

This pattern includes three examples:

* [Single Level](#single_level)
* [Multi Level](#multi_level)
* [Dropdown Menu](#dropdown)

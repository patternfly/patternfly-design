This template should provide detailed design solutions and the interactions and behaviors for each solution. Brief, concise explanations of steps to complete an interaction and any rules of engagement for the UI, should be specified.

Templates to generate mock ups or wireframes can be found here;  https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-design/tree/master/resources/templates   
These are not final visual implementations of the design solutions, and should focus on communicating flow and interactive behaviors.

Provide a bulleted list of the variations on the pattern.

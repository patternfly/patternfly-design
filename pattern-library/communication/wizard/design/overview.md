# Wizard

Wizards should be used when the user needs to go through a sequential set of steps to complete a task. A wizard is a good way to break a complex task into sub-tasks that can be more readily understood and completed. More complex wizards can have branching which takes the user to a different step depending on their settings/answers to previous questions. Wizards should appear in a [Modal](/pattern-library/forms-and-controls/modal-overlay/).

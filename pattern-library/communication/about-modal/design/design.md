# About Modal

![About modal with callouts](./img/about-modal-callouts.png)

1. **Modal:** The About Modal leverages the existing [modal](http://www.patternfly.org/pattern-library/widgets/#modal) in PatternFly. Upon opening the modal, the background behind it should “dim” in order to provide a focused view, reducing confusion. The modal should use the default position; top and centered on the screen.
1. **Close Button:** Clicking the close button (pficon-close) will dismiss the modal and return the background to it’s original state.
1. **Title:** Title of product.
1. **Content:** Label and version. Adequate spacing and font weight consideration should be provided for legibility. Two columns are available for versions that contain both a release name and version number or in the event more space is needed.<br>
We are utilizing the following:<br>
When version and build information are both shown:
Version 6.3 (Build 5)<br>
When version only:
Version 6.3<br>
When build only:
Build 5
1. **Trademark & Copyright info:** Optionally include legal text.
Suggested format for copyright: Copyright (c) 2018 Company
1. **Corner Graphic:** Corner graphic allows the opportunity for branding.

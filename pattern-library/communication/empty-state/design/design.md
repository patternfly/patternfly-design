## Description

![Empty State with Callouts](./img/empty-state-new.png)

1. **Icon** (optional): If an object icon is associated with this view, it can be displayed here.
1. **Empty State Title:** Give it a name.
1. **Text** (optional): This text should be personal and helpful. It should minimize the userâ€™s effort to complete tasks.
1. **Primary Action Button:** The primary action is displayed as a prominent blue button. See the [Action Labels](http://www.patternfly.org/styles/terminology-and-wording/#action-labels) section for more information about terminology and wording specific to action labels.
1. **Secondary Action Buttons** (optional): Secondary actions are alternative options for the user. They are shown as more subtle gray buttons and located below the main action. There can be more than one secondary action. Here are some additional variants for displaying secondary actions:


  - In the case of differing action label lengths, set a consistent button width based on the longest action label.

  - If there are more than 3 secondary actions, we recommend using text links in place of buttons.

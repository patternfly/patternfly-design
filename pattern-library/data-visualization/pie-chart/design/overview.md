# Pie Chart

Pie charts are used to show percentage or proportional data. On hover, the percentage of each category is provided in a tooltip. The pieces of a pie chart must add up to 100%. It is recommended that there is no more than six categories per one pie chart. Sections within a pie chart may be hard to compare to each other so you should use a pie chart when you want to compare an individual section to the whole. If you wish to show the exact value of each category, please check out the [Bar Chart pattern](https://www.patternfly.org/pattern-library/data-visualization/bar-chart).

# Pie Chart

Pie charts are commonly used to show percentages or proportional data. Segments within a pie chart may be hard to compare to each other so you should use a pie chart when you want to compare an individual section to the whole. If you wish to show the exact value of each data point, please check out the [Bar Chart pattern](https://www.patternfly.org/pattern-library/data-visualization/bar-chart).

On hover, the percentage value of each segment is provided in a tooltip. The sum of all of the segments of the chart must equal 100%. It is recommended that there are no more than six segments per single pie chart.

# Utilization Bar Chart

The Utilization Bar Chart can be used to show a visual relationship between the total available amount of a resource, and the percentage of that resource that has been utilized. For example, it would be appropriate to use a Utilization Bar Chart to show the user how much storage he has used in context of the total amount of storage he has purchased.

It is recommended that you pair this chart with a label or heading to tell the users which data points are represented. No specified pattern is prescribed for this label, so style it in a way that makes sense for your use. You may find the [Utilization Bar Card](http://www.patternfly.org/pattern-library/cards/utilization-bar-card) pattern useful.

The Utilization Bar Chart differs slightly from the [Progress Bar Widget](https://www.patternfly.org/pattern-library/widgets/#progress-bars), which is used to show the percentage of a process or set of tasks that have been completed.

Currently, PatternFly has not collected user research data on this pattern. If you'd like to contribute to this documentation, please see our [Get Started guide](http://www.patternfly.org/get-started/contribute/) for details.

# Standardize Display for Missing Data Points on a Chart

In some cases of the chart display, information cannot be retrieved, how do we display the charts that no data was collected nor can be displayed？How do we display missing data points in time based charts？

We recommend different ways of visualizing 0 data with missed data point for different chart types ( Bar / Line / Pie / Donut / Area ).

See [Design details](#design.md).

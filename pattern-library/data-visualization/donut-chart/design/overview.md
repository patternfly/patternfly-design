# Donut Chart

The most common use case for a Donut Chart are:
- Show progress completion as a percentage.
- Show utilization for an object as a percentage.
- Show the relationship of a set of values to a whole.

## Utilization
When using a Donut Chart to show utilization, the entire donut should add up to 100% and the fill represents a percentage of that. You can show that a threshold has been reach by using red, orange or green colors. Otherwise, use the blue color when thresholds are not present. Consider using the [Utilization Bar Chart](https://patternfly.org/pattern-library/data-visualization/utilization-bar-chart) to show utilization in more limited spaces.

## Relationship of a Set of Values to a Whole
When using a Donut Chart to show the relationship of a set of values to a whole, the pieces must add up to 100% and there should be no more than six categories. Sections within a Donut Chart may be hard to compare to each other so you should use a Donut Chart when you want to compare an individual section to the whole. Consider using a [Bar Chart](https://patternfly.org/pattern-library/data-visualization/bar-chart) if you would like to compare one category to another.

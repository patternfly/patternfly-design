# Table View

## Overview

The table view organizes data into rows (of items) and columns (of item attributes). Tables make structured data easy to scan, compare, sort, and analyze. Tables can be embedded into other design patterns. Tables are familiar to users and often the correct choice for structured data, but be careful not to overuse tables. Here are some examples of when not to use a table:

The table pattern should **NOT** be used if:

- Users need to find patterns within a data set. Consider a line chart or a bar chart.
- Users need to browse the data set without knowing exactly what to look for. Consider using a [List View](https://www.patternfly.org/pattern-library/content-views/list-view/#/api).

  1. **Title:**
    Identify a name for the trend being displayed. If the title does not require much emphasis and the trend is on the right, you may opt to place the title under the actual value versus the top left of the card.

  1. **Actual Value or Percentage:**
    Shows the current value or percentage. The position may vary dependent on usage. Placement options for the actual value include:

      - Above the sparkline

      - Left of the sparkline

      - Right of the sparkline

  1. **Total Value** (optional):
    If needed, provide total value next to the actual value to help provide context.

  1. **Unit of Measurement:**
    The label for unit of measurement is shown after the the value.

  1. **Sparkline:**
    See the [Sparkline pattern](https://www.patternfly.org/pattern-library/data-visualization/sparkline/) for more details.

  1. **Tooltip:**
    Use a tooltip on hover to display additional information about exact points on the sparkline (e.g. values and/or percentages). A vertical line and marker helps to accentuate the hover point.

  1. **Time Frame** (optional): The time frame on a card is optional since there could be a single instance of the time frame label or time frame filter that applies to all cards within a single view. The time frame is indicated by placing a label on one of the following areas:

      - Under the title

      - Under the sparkline
      
      - In a [Time Frame Filter](http://www.patternfly.org/pattern-library/cards/base-card/#/design#time-frame-filter-optional)

  1. **Actions Panel** (optional):
    See [Actions Panel](http://www.patternfly.org/pattern-library/cards/base-card/#/design#actions-panel-optional) under the Cards pattern for more details.

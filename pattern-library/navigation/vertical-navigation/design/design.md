## Primary Navigation
![navigation-primary-callout](img/navigation-primary-callout.png)

1. **Masthead:** The tall masthead option is used with the vertical navigation. See the   [Masthead](https://www.patternfly.org/pattern-library/application-framework/masthead/#_) pattern for more details.
2. **Primary Navigation Icons** (optional): When the primary areas of the UI are easily represented by icons, they may be used in the primary navigation.
3. **Hover**: On hover, the primary navigation item is highlighted.
4. **Selection**: A selected primary navigation item is highlighted and includes a vertical blue line decorator.

## Primary with Secondary Navigation
Secondary navigation is non-persistent, appearing on hover. The secondary navigation is shown in a second column that appears to the right. (See [Secondary Navigation | Responsive State](#secondary-navigation-|-responsive-state) for how the secondary navigation is displayed on small screens.)

![navigation-with-secondary-callout](img/navigation-with-secondary-callout.png)

1. **Label**: The label at the top of the secondary menu mirrors the selected primary category to reinforce the user’s current location.
2. **Selection**: A selected item in the secondary navigation is highlighted.
3. **Hover**: On hover, the secondary navigation is highlighted and underlined.

## Primary with Fly Out Secondary Navigation
Fly out secondary navigation acts the same as the [Primary with Secondary Navigation](#primary-with-secondary-navigation), but provides an option for when a whole column is not needed for the navigation items. This is ideal for a smaller set of secondary navigation throughout the entire application. This should not be mixed with the base [Primary with Secondary Navigation](#primary-with-secondary-navigation). The fly out secondary navigation is shown in a fly out that appears to the right. (See [Secondary Navigation | Responsive State](#secondary-navigation-|-responsive-state) for how the secondary navigation is displayed on small screens. NOTE: This is the same for if you are using the [Primary with Secondary Navigation](#primary-with-secondary-navigation).)

2. **Hover**: On hover, the secondary navigation is highlighted and underlined.

## Primary with Tertiary Navigation
Tertiary navigation is non-persistent and only appears on hover. The tertiary navigation is shown as a third column that opens to the right.

![navigation-with-tertiary-callout](img/navigation-with-tertiary-callout.png)

1. **Pin Menu** (optional):
  - If the secondary navigation is pinned, the navigation is collapsed to a single column and the secondary navigation is the only menu visible.
  - If the tertiary navigation is pinned, the navigation is collapsed to a single column and the tertiary navigation is the only menu visible.
2. **Label**:
  - The label at the top of the secondary navigation mirrors the selected primary category to reinforce the user’s current location.
  - The label at the top of the tertiary navigation mirrors the selected secondary category to reinforce the user’s current location.
3. **Selection**: A selected item in the tertiary navigation is highlighted.
4. **Hover**: On hover, the tertiary navigation is highlighted and underlined.

## Responsive States
![navigation-vertical-responsive1](img/navigation-vertical-responsive1@2x.png)
- **Small Screen** (From 768 to 1200px): In all cases, the secondary navigation, if one exists, will replace the primary menu in a one column layout (same interactions as full-width without icons).

![navigation-vertical-responsive2](img/navigation-vertical-responsive2.png)
- **Mobile** (less than 768 px): The masthead utility items and navbar will be hidden under “hamburger” icon. The logotype and the “hamburger” icon will stack into two line. The Product logo will be hidden only remain the product name. The product name will collapse on scroll.


### Primary Navigation | Responsive State

![navigation-vertical-responsive3](img/navigation-vertical-responsive3.png)

1. **Menu Drawer**: When open, the menu appears as a drawer sliding out from the left edge of the viewport. This will overlay content area.
2. **Utility Items**:
  - Once the utility items do not fit in the masthead (on mobile devices), they will responsively move to rest underneath the menu drawer in the vertical navigation.
  - In any instance that there is an icon present in desktop state with no text label (for example, the help icon), a text label will appear next to that icon in this responsive state.

![navigation-vertical-responsive4](img/navigation-vertical-responsive4.png)
1. **Back Link**: Clicking the back link restores the primary-level menu.
2. **Item Selected**: When enter the secondary navigation, the first item will be highlighted by default in responsive state.
3. **Secondary Menu for Utility Item**: The secondary menu will not be highlighted by default in responsive state. User could chose to click either of the item.

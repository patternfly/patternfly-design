# Breadcrumbs

  1. **Primary Navigation Item:** The primary navigation item should always be the first item listed in the breadcrumb string. If the primary navigation items do not have a landing page, this item should not be listed as a link.
  2. **Icon:**  The "fa-angle-double-right" Font Awesome icon should be used to separate levels in the breadcrumb string.
  3. **Links:** All drill down pages that the user can navigate back to, should be shown as links in the breadcrumb string. The underline should appear when the user hovers over a link.
  4. **Current Location:** The end of the breadcrumb string should represent the page a user is currently viewing. This string should be bold text and should not be a link.
  5. **Divider** (optional): A horizontal divider may be present below the breadcrumbs depending on the page layout used inside an application. If this format is used, it should be used consistently throughout the application.

When secondary navigation items are hidden, breadcrumbs may be used in conjunction with horizontal navigation.

## Example with Optional Page Title

1. **Current Location:** The end of the breadcrumb can also play the role of page title in an effort to conserve vertical space. This option would include use of a larger font for the end of the breadcrumb string. If this format is used, it should be used consistently throughout the application.

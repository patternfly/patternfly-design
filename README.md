patternfly-design is awesome!
=============================

The patternfly-design repo is where the designs for the [patternfly open interface project](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly) and the content for [patternfly.org](https://www.patternfly.org) are created and housed.

This open format enables community members and Patternfly team members to easily access and contribute to design documentation and assets. It also has the benefit of dramatically reducing overhead for posting to [patternfly.org](https://www.patternfly.org), as the site can consume the markdown files submitted by designers.

A listing and status of the design patterns in this site is available at: http://www.patternfly.org/patternfly-design/status/

Designing with Git
--

We understand that many designers may not be familiar with Git, and so have prepared a set of instructions that outline a workflow using the Git GUI tool [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com). This tool is not necessary to contribute, but we feel that it provides a good starting point for beginners, and is robust enough to be useful for more advanced use-cases as well.

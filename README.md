patternfly-design is awesome!
=============================

The "patternfly-design" repo houses the design documentation for the PatternFly project. Accepted content will be merged into the "patternfly-design" repo, so that they can appear on the [patternfly.org](https://www.patternfly.org), website.

This open format enables contributors to easily access and contribute design documentation and assets. It also has the benefit of dramatically reducing overhead for posting to [patternfly.org](https://www.patternfly.org), as the site can automatically consume the markdown files submitted by designers.

A listing of design patterns and their status and status are available at: http://www.patternfly.org/patternfly-design/status/
